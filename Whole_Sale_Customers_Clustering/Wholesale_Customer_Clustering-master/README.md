# Wholesale Customer Clustering
This is a capstone project for Masterclass course. Required permission has been taken to use the data for analytical purpose. The data is a synthetic one because organizations do not release such data, but the features are realistic and hand-vetted.

## Project Context:
Our client is an online retailer based in the UK. They sell all-occasion gifts, and many of their customers are wholesalers.
- Most of their customers are from the UK, but they have a small percent of customers from other countries.
-    They want to create groups of these international customers based on their previous purchase patterns.
  -  The client wants to provide more tailored services and improve the way they market to these international customers.

## Dataset:
Transactional data of international customers have been provided by the retailer client. The data is provided in a csv file **(int_online_tx.csv)** and it is a synthetic dataset but with realistic features. 

## Goal:
The goal is to ***build a clustering model which will make customer clusters and should factor in both aggregate sales pattern and specific items purchased***.

So, the problem specifics are :

    Deliverable: Clusters for customers
    Machine Learning Task: Clustering
    Target Variable: N/A (Unsupervised learning)
    Win Condition: Subjective Results
