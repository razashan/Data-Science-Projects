# HR_Employee_Retention
This is a capstone project for Masterclass course. Required permission has been taken to use the data for analytical purpose. The data is a synthetic one because organizations do not release such data, but the features are realistic and hand-vetted.  

## Project Context:


The HR department at a large company wants to unveil a new initiative to proactively retain their employees.
Using data, they are looking to identify employees who are likely to leave and take proactive actions to reach out to those employees before it's too late.
The HR department only cares about the permanent employees for this initiative.

## Current Structure:


The department currently arrange an 'exit-interview' and ask employees to share their reason for leaving.
HR tries to learn insight from the interview and make changes in the company. The issue here is that HR can't aggregate all these insights systematically.
This structure doesn't allow proactive actions, because here 'exit-interviews' are driving the policy changes.

## Goal:


The goal here is to build a model which can identify those employees who are likely to leave.
