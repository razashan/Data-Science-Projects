# MLND_P2 : Finding Donors for Charity
A Supervised Machine Learning project using Scikit Learn to predict donors for a charity organization.
This is the 3rd project in Udacity Machine Learning Nano-Degree program.

## Project Description

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought us on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Our goal will be to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learning algorithms to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield, while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

In this project, we will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) to identify people most likely to donate to their cause. We will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded and then will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. We will then evaluate several supervised learners of choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, we will optimize the selected model and present it as the solution to CharityML. Finally, we will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
